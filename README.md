Overview

This repository contains all code, notebooks, and outputs for a project investigating whether college statistics, NBA Draft Combine measurements, and biographical data can predict a player’s Rookie Player Efficiency Rating (PER).

We merged three public datasets into a unified table (217 players, 97 features) and trained multiple machine learning models. Ensemble tree methods significantly outperformed linear models and neural networks, with XGBoost achieving the strongest predictive performance.

The repo includes:

Data preparation and cleaning

Feature engineering

Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network)

Visualizations and outputs
